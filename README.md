# Experiment: WebGL Refraction Shader

A small experiment I made to explore WebGL.

The link below will take you to a spinning glass-like donut. It's built using [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) with a custom [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) shader for sampling the background based on the surface normals (curvature) to produce a surface that appears to be transparent with the refractive index of glass.
